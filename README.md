Stuck inside a hourglass, two players have a challenge to face:

As long as the sand is flowing down, you must find the jars and 
bring them to the key zones to score, then try to get points as

In this project i programmed the mechanics of the game 

The main challenge was the code and setup of multiples controlers 
for local multiplayer

due to the fact that is was a game jam the code is not the most 
optimal but it worked propreli for the game
